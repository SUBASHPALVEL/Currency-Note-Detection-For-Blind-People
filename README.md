# Currency-Note-Detection-For-Blind-People
It is a currency note detection project created for blind people. #SUBASHPALVEL #SubashPalvel #subashpalvel


This time, we worked on a project that is socially significant and designed to help blind people recognise
Indian currency. The process of recognising a currency's denominational value is known as currency
recognition. Although it is a simple and uncomplicated exercise for many individuals, recognising
currency might be difficult for persons who are vision impaired. Those who are visually impaired have
trouble telling the difference between various monetary denominations. The task is still too challenging
and time-consuming for the blind even though different currencies in India have distinctive symbols
engraved on them. So, we created a system that reliably recognises currency using a machine learning
algorithm that was trained on 1.2 GB of currency image data. To acquire the most accurate results from
the data we gathered, the model is trained with 50 epoches. The outcomes of our training this model using
different compilers are as follows. The configuration of the local machine we trained on includes Ryzen
550U and 8GB RAM.

As can be seen from the comparison above, training a model on a local machine requires a lot of time, making it impossible for a student to complete. Nevertheless, by using cloud compilers like Google Colab and Intel OneApi, we substantially cut the time, making it easier and more accessible for students to learn AI and ML.
